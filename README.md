# Barmark

Barmark is markdown parser, written in C.

# Goals:
- Build a large, performant project in C
- Pass all of the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) [spec tests](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/)
  - Last time this was updated (2023-10-19), it was passing 301 of 652 (~46%).
- Once that's done, work on performance improvements and see how close I can get compared to the CommonMark reference implementation.
