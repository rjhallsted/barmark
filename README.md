# Barmark

Barmark is markdown parser, written in C.

# Goals:
- Build a large, performant project in C
- Pass all of the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) [spec tests](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/)
  - Last time this was updated (2023-10-03), it was passing 243 of 652.
- Once that's done, work on performance improvements and see how close I can get compared to the CommonMark reference implementation.
